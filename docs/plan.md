# Threadbear: Mike's own agent app

Working name. It's a thread app with only the things Mike uses and nothing
more, hence threadbear. Easy to rename while it's young.

## Why

Mike runs most of his work through T3 Code, a desktop app that drives Claude
Code and Codex as threads. He likes snoozing threads, settling them and getting
archived ones back quickly, provider updates and usage stats. He doesn't like
being made to pick a project every time (it's nearly always misc), Codex image
generation not showing up, images being half broken in general, the Electron
app weight, and agents dying when the app quits or updates. He wants an app
that opens fast, stays light with lots of threads, does exactly what he uses,
and later shows his threads on his phone and runs work on other machines.

## Shape

Two pieces, both on Mike's MacBook to start:

1. **Runner** (`runner/`, TypeScript on Node 24): a launchd daemon that owns
   every agent process. It drives the official CLIs only: Claude Code through
   the Claude Agent SDK (the same way T3 does), Codex through `codex
   app-server` later. It persists threads, normalises events, stops idle CLIs
   and resumes them by session id, and serves a local WebSocket JSON-RPC API
   (see `docs/protocol.md`). Quitting or updating the app never kills a turn.
2. **App** (`app/`, Swift, SwiftPM, macOS 26): a native SwiftUI shell with an
   AppKit `NSTableView` transcript. It's a client of the runner and holds no
   agent state of its own.

## Build order and where it stands (29 Oct 2026)

The order Mike agreed on 26 Oct, and what became of each step:

- **Steps 1 to 3: runner and Mac app v1**, then the design pass and the
  dev tools (`docs/design-pass.md`, `docs/dev-tools.md`). Done 26 to 27 Oct.
- **Step 4: Codex threads, every login, usage in the app, CLI
  auto-updates** (`docs/step4-plan.md`). Done 27 Oct. Pools
  (`docs/pools-plan.md`) came on top: the runner picks the login per turn.
- **Step 5: Convex and the phone** (`docs/convex-backend.md`): thread
  summaries, recent messages, approvals, projects and schedules mirrored to
  Convex, phone commands, push when a thread needs Mike. Done 28 Oct, and
  bigger than planned: Threadbear got its own iPhone app (1.0 in App
  Review) and a website with sharing, rather than a Threads tab in Quick
  Ask.
- **Step 6: a second runner, then cloud sandboxes.** The second runner is
  done and supported: Bruce since 29 Oct, then a Linux server. Set one up
  with INSTALL.md; the guide's "If you run Threadbear on more than one Mac"
  says how it behaves. The plan said Tinker Desk; on 29 Oct Mike moved it
  to Bruce, keeping Tinker Desk for testing clean Threadbear installs. Cloud
  sandboxes were a separate idea, not settled.

Much was added outside this order: schedules, hibernate, projects and the
librarian, the dockable window (BearDock), patches and panels, the asks card,
handovers for runner and app restarts, message editing and sharing. Their
docs are in `docs/` and the contracts in `docs/protocol.md`.

## Step 6: a second runner (Bruce)

Built. `docs/step6-plan.md` is the 29 Oct design it started from; for how
it works today read the guide and `docs/protocol.md`, "Runner keys".

## Behaviour Mike asked for

- **No project picker.** New threads start in `~/dev/me/misc` on the last-used
  account. The folder, account and model are small controls on the composer
  you can change if you want, never a required step.
- **Snooze** a thread until a time (presets: 1 hour, this evening 6 pm,
  tomorrow 9 am, next Monday 9 am, pick a time). It disappears from the list
  and comes back marked unread when the time passes. Snoozing stops its CLI.
- **Archive** (Mike calls this settling) with ⌘E: the thread leaves the inbox
  and its CLI stops. The Archive view lists archived threads newest first with
  search, and "Unarchive" puts one straight back. Archived threads are as
  quick to open as live ones.
- **Images work.** Pasted or dropped images are saved as files and sent to the
  agent; images agents read or generate are saved into the thread's media
  folder and shown inline as thumbnails; click opens Quick Look.
- **Speed.** Cold start to a usable window well under a second. Switching
  threads feels instant. Hundreds of threads and transcripts of 4,000+ rows
  stay smooth. Idle threads cost nothing (no CLI running).
- **Light.** Only threads that are running or were used in the last 30
  minutes keep a CLI process.

## Runner details

- Data dir `~/Library/Application Support/Threadbear/`:
  `runner.json` (port, defaults), `secrets/runner-token` (0600, random),
  `threads/<threadId>/thread.json` (summary, atomic writes),
  `threads/<threadId>/events.ndjson` (append-only persisted events),
  `threads/<threadId>/media/` (images), `threads/<threadId>/blobs/` (tool
  output over 64 KB), `inbox/` (images the app drops before sending),
  logs in `~/Library/Logs/threadbear-runner.log`.
- Listens on `127.0.0.1:8797`, WebSocket path `/rpc`, authenticated with the
  token in the secrets file by a challenge both sides answer, so the token
  itself never goes over the socket (docs/protocol.md, "Auth").
- launchd LaunchAgent `com.mikerosoft.threadbear.runner`, KeepAlive, with the
  Node path pinned in the plist (`--node`, `THREADBEAR_NODE`, else the
  node on PATH or nvm's newest Node 24 or Homebrew's, by
  `runner/scripts/find-node.sh`). Its program is `~/Applications/Threadbear
  Runner.app`, a small signed app (`runner/launcher/`) that runs `node
  launch.mjs` as its child: macOS attributes privacy prompts (Desktop,
  Documents, Dropbox, ...) to the LaunchAgent's program and everything under
  it, so they say "Threadbear Runner" rather than "node", and the grants
  stay with the app when Node updates (28 Oct 2026). Don't use
  `node:sqlite` (it truncates text at NUL on Node 24); plain files are
  enough.
- **Accounts.** Discover Claude logins: `~/.claude` (id `claude-main`) and each
  `~/Library/Application Support/Token Stats/Accounts/claude-N` (id
  `claude-N`). Title from the login's email in its `.claude.json`
  (`oauthAccount.emailAddress`; read only that field, never tokens).
- **Claude adapter** (`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`, pin the current
  version, 0.3.310 on 2026-10-26):
  - One `query()` per live thread in streaming-input mode (an async queue).
  - `pathToClaudeCodeExecutable` = `~/.local/bin/claude`, the shared native
    install (SDK sessions never update it: only the terminal UI,
    `claude update` and `claude install` do, so step 4 adds Threadbear's own
    update checks); `env` = `{...process.env, CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR}` for
    non-main accounts (and with `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` removed for `claude-main`).
  - `cwd` per thread; `settingSources: ['user','project','local']`;
    `systemPrompt: {type:'preset', preset:'claude_code'}`;
    `includePartialMessages: true`; thinking summaries on.
  - New thread: pre-assign `sessionId` (uuid). Resume: `resume: sessionId`.
  - Permission mode per thread: `full` (default, `bypassPermissions` with
    `allowDangerouslySkipPermissions`, which is how Mike runs T3) or `ask`
    (`default` mode with `canUseTool` turned into approval events).
    `AskUserQuestion` always surfaces as a question event the app answers.
  - Model: omit to use the account's settings default; optional per-thread
    override.
  - Interrupt with `query.interrupt()`.
  - Idle release: 30 minutes after a turn ends with nothing pending, or
    immediately on snooze/archive, end the input so the CLI exits. The next
    send starts a new `query()` with `resume`. Never run two live queries on
    one session. Kill the CLI's process group if the runner exits.
  - Title: first line of the first message, trimmed to 60 characters,
    then a small model's title, on a Claude login in the small-jobs pool
    (src/models/).
- **Adapter interface** so Codex can be added without touching the rest.
- **Startup:** threads that were live when the runner stopped become
  `stopped`; any approval that was pending is marked expired.
- Write a small CLI, `runner/bin/tb`, for testing and scripting: `tb new
  "text" [--cwd] [--account]`, `tb send <id> "text"`, `tb list`, `tb tail
  <id>`, `tb archive <id>`.

## App details

- SwiftPM package in `app/`: `ThreadbearCore` (no AppKit/SwiftUI: protocol
  models, WebSocket JSON-RPC client, event reducer that turns events into
  transcript rows, markdown block splitter, diff builder), `Threadbear`
  (executable: SwiftUI + AppKit), `ThreadbearCoreTests` (XCTest). swift-tools
  6.2, macOS 26. Copy Token Stats' `build-app.sh`, `restart.sh`, `kill.sh`,
  `install.sh` and launcher pattern
  (`~/dev/me/mikerosoft-tools/token-stats`); bundle id
  `com.mikerosoft.threadbear`; sign with the first "Apple Development"
  identity, falling back to ad hoc, with a stable designated requirement.
- **Window:** a dock of panels (BearDock, `dock/`; was a `NavigationSplitView`
  until 28 Oct 2026): the sidebar, the thread and the pane sections, each
  movable, tabbable and closable, no title bar. Sidebar sections: Inbox (everything not
  running, what needs Mike first: questions and approvals, then unread
  replies, then the rest; Needs you merged into it 27 Oct), Running at the
  bottom, then a footer button for Snoozed and Archive views. Each row: title,
  one-line preview, relative time, small status dot, account badge only if
  it isn't the default. ⌘N new thread, ⌘E archive. (No inbox search since
  design pass 1; the Archive view keeps its own.)
- **Transcript:** view-based `NSTableView` in an `NSViewRepresentable`, one
  row per item: user message, assistant text, reasoning (collapsed), tool
  call with result (one collapsed line with an icon and a short title,
  expandable), diff (for Edit/MultiEdit/Write), image grid, approval or
  question card, turn footer (duration, cost), error. Rules from the research:
  - Assistant text rendered with swift-markdown into an `NSAttributedString`
    in a non-editable, selectable TextKit 1 `NSTextView`
    (`usingTextLayoutManager: false`). Code blocks monospaced with a subtle
    background; syntax colouring can come later.
  - Row heights cached by (row id, content version, width); measured off the
    main thread where possible.
  - Open at the bottom with the last ~200 rows and page older ones in when
    scrolling up, keeping the visible row anchored.
  - Streaming: coalesce to at most 30 updates a second; finished markdown
    blocks are frozen; only the last open block is re-rendered; update one
    row with `noteHeightOfRows` and no animation; follow the bottom only if
    the user is already at the bottom.
  - Drive the table with row inserts and reloads, not full reloads.
  - Images: read pixel size from the file header for layout, decode
    thumbnails off the main thread at drawn size into an `NSCache`.
  - Copy message and "Copy transcript as Markdown" since selection can't span
    rows.
- **Composer:** multi-line text view at the bottom, Return sends,
  Shift-Return newline, paste or drop images (saved into the runner's
  `inbox/`), Stop while running, and small menus for folder, account, model
  and "Ask before edits".
- **Approvals and questions:** a card in the transcript with Allow, Always
  allow and Deny (or the question's options). Threads that need Mike float to
  Needs you and post a local notification when the app isn't showing them.
- **Runner connection:** reconnect with backoff; if the runner isn't running,
  show a plain message with a Start button (`launchctl kickstart`).
- Copy: plain words, no eyebrow or kicker labels, no em dashes.

## Performance bar

On the M5 and Tinker Desk (M2, 16 GB):
- open a 4,100-row thread to first paint in 100 ms or less,
- switch threads in 50 ms or less,
- fling top to bottom with no hang over 100 ms and no jumps when not pinned,
- 60 s of 30 Hz streaming while scrolled up uses 30% of one core or less,
- 200 MB or less with 20 threads loaded and the biggest one open.

`app/Tools/fixture-export` turns real Claude JSONL into event fixtures
(gitignored, they contain private text) for these tests.

`app/Tools/perf-run.sh` measures all of these against the mock runner and
prints which bars are met.

Results so far:

- **26 Oct, M5, v1.** Every bar met but memory: 253 MB one second after
  loading 20 threads (105 MB of it graphics), 152 MB settled.
- **29 Oct, Tinker Desk, main at 10fedd8** (after the dock, panels and
  link peeks). Every bar met but the first open after launch: 185 ms for
  the biggest thread (later first opens 74 to 95 ms). Switches p95 45 ms,
  fling max frame gap 53 ms with no jumps, streaming scrolled up 9.4% of a
  core, memory 164 MB (174 MB peak) on its 1080p display.
  Mike, 29 Oct: the 185 ms first open isn't worth chasing now.
- The M5 hasn't been measured since 26 Oct: on 29 Oct its load average was
  over 200 from other threads' builds, which would skew every number.

Two things to know when comparing runs. The reducer now folds more events
into each row, so the "4,100-row" fixture is about 2,450 rows (4,454 on 26
Oct). And on Tinker Desk the run needs `caffeinate -u -d`: with the display
asleep the app gets no frames and the fling waits forever.

## Trial

Done: by 29 Oct Mike was running his threads in Threadbear. The original
test was to use it next to T3 for a week and stop if the transcript wasn't
nicer than T3's, since the shared memory and the Connectors gateway were
worth having anyway.
