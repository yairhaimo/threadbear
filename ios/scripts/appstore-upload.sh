# Archive a Release build of Threadbear for iOS, export it for App Store Connect and (with UPLOAD=1)
# upload it. Signing is automatic and cloud-managed, through the App Store Connect API key in
# ~/.config/poddle (no Xcode account or local distribution certificate needed).
#
#   ios/scripts/appstore-upload.sh            archive, export and validate a signed .ipa; no upload
#   UPLOAD=1 ios/scripts/appstore-upload.sh   archive, export, then upload it to App Store Connect
#   UPLOAD=1 BUILD_NUMBER=<b> ios/scripts/appstore-upload.sh
#                                             upload a build this script already archived in
#                                             OUT, without archiving it again
#
# Each run gets a new build number, the UTC time as YYMMDDHHMM (always increasing), unless
# BUILD_NUMBER is set, like Walkies' and Quick Ask's (this script is theirs, copied). The version
# (MARKETING_VERSION, 1.0.0) comes from the project. Everything lands in OUT (default
# ~/Library/Caches/Threadbear/ios-builds/appstore/<build>).
#
# OUT and the derived data (DD) must be this account's alone, mode 700 with no ACL letting anyone
# else in (scripts/private-dir.mjs; move an old one away and a fresh one is made): they were
# fixed names under /tmp until 8 Nov, where another account on the Mac could make the folder
# first and plant an archive this script would then sign and upload. An archive already in OUT is
# only reused when BUILD_NUMBER names it, this script finished it (archived.txt beside it), and
# nothing in it belongs to or can be written by another account; otherwise it's archived afresh.
#
# `altool --validate-app` runs without UPLOAD=1 (VALIDATE=0 skips it) and is skipped with it, as
# the upload validates the build anyway: on 7 Nov it sat silent for 8+ minutes while the upload on
# its own took two and came back VALID. VALIDATE=1 runs it before an upload too. It gets
# VALIDATE_TIMEOUT seconds (default 300); running out is a warning, not a failure.
# The API key is Poddle's team-wide one (same team), read from ~/.config/poddle and never printed.
