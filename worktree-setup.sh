# Sets up a thread's own worktree of Threadbear (docs/thread-worktrees.md):
# node_modules for the repo root (the Convex functions), the runner and
# the mock runner. The runner runs it in
# the new worktree before the thread's first turn
# (.threadbear/patches/checks.ts); it's safe to run again.
#
# Where the main checkout has the same package-lock.json and has installed
# it, node_modules is a symlink to the main checkout's: a moment, rather
# than an npm ci of some 350 MB for every thread. The symlinks are
# gitignored (.gitignore's node_modules matches them). Otherwise, or if the
# main checkout has nothing installed, it's a real npm ci here.
#
# A thread that changes a package.json or package-lock.json replaces the
# link with its own install first: `rm runner/node_modules` (no trailing
# slash: that removes the link, not the main checkout's files), then
# `npm ci` there. Never npm install through the link.
