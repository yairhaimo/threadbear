With one Mac and a few threads a day that should fit on Convex's <a href=\"https://www.convex.dev/pricing\">free plan</a> very comfortably. If you use it as much as I do you'll go over, but on Starter that only comes to about US$1.50 a month."],

A Linux server can be a second, always-on machine though (<a href=\"https://github.com/mikecann/threadbear/blob/main/INSTALL.md#6-a-runner-on-linux-optional\">section 6 of INSTALL.md</a> has how), so your threads can run there while you drive them from your Mac, your phone or the website. If you want a proper Windows or Linux version then I thoroughly encourage you to spend some tokens and build it, I'd personally love to see it. Taylor Rupe has already got one going on Windows through WSL in <a href=\"https://github.com/t-rupe/threadbear/blob/main/wsl/README.md\">their own fork</a>, with no Mac needed (you use the website and the iPhone app instead). I haven't tried it myself, so get your agent to check it over first."],

  ["Does it use my subscription or an API key?",
    "Your subscription. Threadbear runs the official <code>claude</code> and <code>codex</code> command line tools, logged in as you, and it never reads or copies your login tokens. Claude threads go through Claude Code's Agent SDK though, and Anthropic's 5-hour limit seems to charge that more per token than typing into a terminal (people have measured anywhere from about 1.6 to 2.9x, while weekly limits look about the same). <a href=\"/docs/accounts\">The docs on accounts</a> have more."],

    "Yes, I've got a few myself. <a href=\"/docs/accounts\">Sign each login in to a folder of its own</a> and Threadbear groups them into pools. A new thread starts on the login whose weekly limit resets soonest, so you use up what would otherwise go to waste. When that login gets close to its limit the thread moves to another one with room and carries on from where it was, and if they're all full it waits and carries on by itself once a limit resets."],

  ["What happens when my Mac's asleep?",
    "You can still read all your threads on your phone and the website, because they're synced to your Convex deployment. The agents run on your Mac though, so they can't do anything while it's asleep (Threadbear won't keep it awake unless you turn on <a href=\"/docs/experiments\">that experiment</a>), and anything you send from your phone waits for it to wake up.

Tool output stays on your Mac. Anything that looks like a secret gets scrubbed out of the text on the way up, but that's not a guarantee, and nothing can scrub a picture.

  // Self-hosting is step 8 of docs/setup-and-updates.md and isn't built, so setup can't do it. With

  ["Do I have to use Convex?",
    "Pretty much, yes (and by the way I work at Convex, so I'm a bit biased). Setup makes a deployment in your own Convex account, and that's how your phone, the website and your other machines see your threads. You can turn the syncing off with <code>\"sync\": { \"enabled\": false }</code> in <code>runner.json</code> and the Mac app carries on by itself, but you'd lose all of that. If you'd rather keep it on your own server, <a href=\"https://docs.convex.dev/self-hosting\">Convex's backend is open source</a> and you can run it yourself, but setup won't do that for you, so that one's up to you and your agent."],

    "Add buttons above the message box that run a command or send a prompt, add panels beside the thread (a web page, or a list Threadbear draws itself), and run a command after each turn, like a typecheck, telling the agent when it fails. A patch is a plain file in your repo, so it gets reviewed and committed like anything else."],
  ["Why would I want my own copy of the code?",

  ["Why is it called Threadbear?",
    "A threadbare teddy is the one you've had for years, worn and patched and loved for it, and that's what I wanted this to be. There are a few bear words in the app too: snoozing a thread is Hibernate, the archive is the Den, and while an agent works it says Bear with me."],
