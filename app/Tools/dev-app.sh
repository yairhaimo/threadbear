#          only the --fixtures folders given: `tb export` puts one thread in
#          app/.fixtures/threads/<id>) or points at a dev runner's --home
#          (runner/scripts/dev-runner.sh), launches the app with
#          --automation, waits until it's connected and prints the id.
# do       sends each command and prints its result line ("open ok ...");
#          exits 1 on an error result or a timeout. The commands are in
#          app/README.md, "Seeing and driving it from a script".
# shot     saves the window as a PNG: screencapture -l from this shell, or
#          the app's own drawing when that gives no image (screen locked,
#          or no Screen Recording permission), which it says.
# dump     what the window shows: the sidebar's rows by section, the open
#          thread's rows (id, kind, height, open or closed, text; > marks
#          the ones on screen), the selection, the composer (its text, and
#          the folder, account, model and access a send would use) and the
#          banner.
# rebuild  builds again and restarts the app with the same options, on the
#          same runner (the mock keeps its state), reopening the thread that
#          was open. A build that fails leaves the running app alone.
# log      the app's own log: connection, RPC errors, automation commands.
# stop     quits the app and its mock and deletes the instance's files.
#
# Instances belong to whoever started them: the Threadbear thread
# (THREADBEAR_THREAD_ID) and this checkout. Without --id a command means
# your newest running instance, never another thread's or another
# checkout's; stop --all stops all of yours (--everyone: every instance on
# this Mac). status lists them all, with whose they are. An app quits after
# 60 minutes with no command, and its mock with it; start and status clean
# up after instances whose app has quit.
