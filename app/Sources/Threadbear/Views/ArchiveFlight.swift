/// The open thread's panel dropping into the Archived heading when it's
/// archived. Mike found the panel just flicking to the next thread flat
/// beside the sidebar's sliding row, and picked this, "D2 · Drop", from
/// mockups (30 Oct; docs/archive-transition-design). It falls first and
/// then curves across into the heading's archive box, shrinking and
/// tipping slightly, like a sheet dropped into a drawer. The box bounces
/// and the count rolls on as it lands (`AppModel.flyingToArchive`), and the
/// next thread fades in underneath.
///
/// The transcript is one table that the next thread reuses straight away,
/// so what flies is a picture of it, in a see-through window over the main
/// one (above the sidebar, and nothing in it takes clicks). The flight is
/// a Core Animation keyframe animation, so it runs in the render server:
/// the first version stepped it from the main thread each frame, and Mike
/// saw only a couple of frames of it (30 Oct), as the same click opens the
/// next thread on the main thread. So the path is worked out at the
/// start, aimed at where the heading will be once the archived row has
/// closed up above it. With the heading out of sight (a long inbox, a lazy
/// list that hasn't drawn it) the picture falls off the bottom of the list
/// instead; with no list (another sidebar view) or under Reduce Motion it
/// just fades.
///
/// Hibernating the open thread is this flight's sleepier sibling (Mike
/// picked it from mockups, 7 Nov): `.hibernate` sinks into the Hibernating
/// heading's moon, slower and softer, level, dimming like the lights going
/// down, and the next thread comes in a little later and slower too.
