// What someone else's copy of this repo shows from its own patches
// (.threadbear/patches): every chip and panel a thread in their fork gets.
// Wayne opened a thread in his fork on 6 Nov and found a Sentry chip
// pointing at Mike's Sentry, which he couldn't open and wasn't meant to see.
//
// The patches load here as on a stranger's Mac: a home folder with nothing
// of Mike's in it (no ~/dev/me/poddle, no keys), so a `when` that looks for
// something of Mike's comes out false. What's left must match SHOWN below.
// Adding to SHOWN means every fork shows it: only things anyone can use
// (public pages, the repo's own scripts), never Mike's accounts. Something
// only Mike needs gets a `when` that checks for something only he has, as
// app-store.ts's onMikesMac does.
