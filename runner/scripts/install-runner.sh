#!/bin/bash
# Installs the Threadbear runner as a launchd LaunchAgent
# (com.mikerosoft.threadbear.runner) that starts at login and is restarted
# if it ever exits. On Linux it's a systemd user service of the same name
# instead (~/.config/systemd/user/<label>.service), with no Runner.app:
# everything below about the plist goes for the unit file there.
#
#   scripts/install-runner.sh              install (or reinstall) and start it
#   scripts/install-runner.sh --print      print the plist and change nothing
#   scripts/install-runner.sh --uninstall  stop it and remove the plist
#
# The runner runs from a release, never from this checkout: the plist
# starts <home>/runner/launch.mjs, which starts the release
# <home>/runner/current points at. The first release is built here; after
# that, ship changes with scripts/deploy-runner.sh.
#
# The plist's program is a small app, ~/Applications/Threadbear Runner.app
# (launcher/main.swift says why: macOS names the LaunchAgent's program in
# its privacy prompts, so this way they say "Threadbear Runner", not
# "node"), which runs `node launch.mjs` as its child. It is built here when
# it's missing or launcher/ changed, and otherwise left alone, so its
# signature, and the privacy grants tied to it, survive runner releases and
# Node updates. A sandbox install builds its own in <home>/runner/.
#
# It replaces a running copy only when no thread is busy (a turn, or
# background shells and subagents), since that stops them; --force does it
# anyway. It keeps the release current names only if it was built from
# HEAD, and otherwise builds one that was. If the new runner doesn't come up
# and stay up until it is marked good (about a minute), the old plist,
# launch.mjs and current are put back; a first install that fails is
# removed again (the releases stay), so launchd isn't left starting a
# program that isn't there.
#
# Options:
#   --from-source  run src/main.ts straight from this checkout instead, as
#                  before releases (for debugging the runner itself)
#   --force        replace the running copy even if threads are busy
#   --allow-branch install from a HEAD that isn't main's tip (its launch.mjs
#                  and release)
#   --home DIR     data dir (default ~/Library/Application Support/Threadbear)
#   --label LABEL  launchd label (default com.mikerosoft.threadbear.runner)
#   --port N       port to listen on (default: the one in runner.json, else
#                  8797). A sandbox next to the real runner needs its own
#                  --home and --label; its port defaults to 0, a free one.
#   --node PATH    Node 24 binary to pin in the plist
#                  (default: $THREADBEAR_NODE, else the node on PATH, else
#                  nvm's newest Node 24 or newer, or Homebrew's)
#   --runner-app DIR  where Threadbear Runner.app goes (default:
#                  $THREADBEAR_RUNNER_APP_DIR, else ~/Applications/Threadbear
#                  Runner.app, or <home>/runner/Threadbear Runner.app for a
#                  sandbox)
#   --path PATH    PATH for the runner and the agents it starts
#                  (default: your login shell's PATH, captured now)
#
# THREADBEAR_LAUNCHCTL and THREADBEAR_LAUNCH_AGENTS_DIR replace launchctl
# and ~/Library/LaunchAgents (the tests use both); on Linux,
# THREADBEAR_SYSTEMCTL and THREADBEAR_SYSTEMD_UNITS_DIR replace systemctl
# and ~/.config/systemd/user.
