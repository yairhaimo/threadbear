// Other runners' threads through the backend (docs/protocol.md, "Other
// runners' threads through the backend"; full Convex step 5). The Mac app
// asks its own runner about another runner's thread as it would about one of
// this runner's, and this answers from the backend: the thread's message rows
// become transcript events, and what the app does to it (send, approve, stop,
// archive) goes to that runner as a `commands` row, as the phone's does. The
// app needs no Convex of its own and no link to the other Mac.
//
// The backend has a thread's text, one line per tool call, its open approval
// and its card. A tool row's result says the output is kept on that runner, and
// carries `heldBack: { seq }`: opening that tool in the app asks for it
// (threads.heldBody), and if that runner has full sync on (docs/full-convex.md
// step 4) its output comes from the backend, once, as more events for the row.
//
// Seqs. The rows' seqs are the other runner's event seqs, with gaps where
// events weren't mirrored. Each row's seq s becomes eight here: 8s a
// turn.started, 8s+1 the row's own event, 8s+2 a tool's result, 8s+3 and
// 8s+4 a card from an older runner that didn't say its seq (placed after the
// newest row when first seen) and its answer (or else a fetched tool's diffs),
// 8s+5 and 8s+6 a fetched tool's real call and result, 8s+7 its turn's end. A card
// whose event seq p is known goes at 8p+1 and its answer at 8p+2 (p is never
// a row's seq). So events made up from a row sit right beside it and stay in
// order, and every one has a seq of its own. The app takes these threads' events with gaps
// and late ones (ThreadFeed's sparse mode), and pages by these seqs.
//
// Reads (docs/full-convex.md, "Read rules"): a thread is watched only while
// an app has it subscribed, through a 15-row tail and its one threads row;
// older rows are read once by page and kept here, and a tail that skips past
// what's held reads the gap once rather than leave a hole.
