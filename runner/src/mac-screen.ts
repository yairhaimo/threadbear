// A dialog left on the screen of a Mac nobody's looking at (docs/protocol.md,
// "A dialog on a Mac's screen").
//
// macOS asks about a protected folder or a removable drive in the name of
// Threadbear Runner, for anything under it, an agent's `find ~/Downloads` or
// a tool that goes looking on a drive. Once a prompt is up it stays up, even
// after whatever asked has gone (tried on Tinker Desk, 1 Nov 2026). And it
// holds up more than its asker: on 31 Oct 2026 a prompt waiting on Bruce's
// locked screen stopped Sammy Cam getting at its external drive from 22:00 to
// 06:43, with its own permission long granted, and nothing said so.
//
// frozen-cli.ts sees this only from inside a turn, and only if the CLI itself
// is the one stuck. So this looks at the screen: the runner tells the prompt
// apart from everything else by the window being UserNotificationCenter's,
// which reads the same on a locked screen and needs no permission.
//
// It's on every Mac rather than only ones thought to be unattended: there's no
// telling that from here (a Mac can have the app and nobody at it), and five
// minutes is long enough that someone at the Mac has already answered.

// osascript costs about 0.2 seconds and 30 MB, gone straight after, so a look
// is cheap but not free on Bruce's 8 GB.
