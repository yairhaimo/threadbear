// Cutting text short without cutting a secret in two. Titles, previews, the
// wake note, ask lines, tool titles and quoted replies are all cut before they
// go to Convex, where they're scrubbed (scrub.ts, redaction.ts). A rule that
// needs the end of a secret to know it (the "@" after a connection URL's
// password, the closing quote of `"password": "..."`, a token's length) no
// longer matches half of one, so a cut through a secret sent the half the
// rules had stopped seeing (Daybreak, 6 Nov: a wake note cut through
// postgres://alice:password@host kept the password).
//
// So a cut never lands inside anything the scrub would take out: it moves back
// to before it. The text itself isn't changed (the runner's own copy of a
// thread never is, scrub.ts), only cut a little shorter when a secret is where
// the cut would be; on the way up the whole secret, or none of it, is there for
// the scrub to see. Callers that build text from cut parts (the wake note out
// of titles and conditions) get whole secrets in each part too.
