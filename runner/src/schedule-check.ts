// A schedule's check (experiment scheduleChecks, experiments.ts): a shell
// command its runner runs before each run, in the schedule's folder. If it
// prints nothing, the run is skipped and no agent starts, so a watcher that
// polls every few minutes costs nothing until there's something to do.
// Whatever it prints goes into the message. A check that fails (exits
// non-zero or times out) doesn't skip the run: the run goes ahead with the
// error, so the agent can see the check is broken rather than it going
// quiet. Cloudroom, Intentic and Paradev gate their automations this way
// (6 Nov 2026, thread d698c77d).
//
// THREADBEAR_CHECK_STATE names a file of the schedule's own that the check
// may keep state in between runs (the last id it saw), and
// THREADBEAR_SCHEDULE_ID is the schedule's id.
//
// A check like that reports each thing once, so what it printed is kept in
// a file of the schedule's own (keptCheckFile) until a run carrying it has
// really been sent, and the run uses that rather than running the check
// again. A restart landing between the check and the send would otherwise
// lose it: the next runner's check finds nothing new (6 Nov 2026, schedule
// 54f11e8a in a handover).
