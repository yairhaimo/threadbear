// Starting a thread that fixes a failed update to main (update.ts), in
// place of the "couldn't update to main" banner.
//
// Mike, 6 Nov 2026: the banner came up often (mostly tests that flaked on a
// busy Mac), told him nothing he could act on, and left him to start a
// thread himself. Now the runner starts that thread in the background. It
// reads the output, fixes the cause on main (or clears the failed record
// when a rerun is all it takes), watches the runner build, and archives
// itself once main goes through, so Mike only hears about it when it needs
// him.
//
// Never more than one: while the last one is open, a failure at a newer
// commit goes to it as a message; the same failure again says nothing.
// Archiving it (it does that itself when it's done) lets the next failure
// start a fresh one.
//
// On a machine that follows GitHub's main (follow-origin.ts) nothing can land:
// bruce's and the Pixel's fix threads committed on their own main on 6 and 9
// Nov, and each machine stopped following for days. There the thread hands
// the fix to the main Mac instead (and tb land refuses).

Threadbear started this thread in the background in place of a banner, on this install's default mode. Fix it without me if you can. If that mode asks before some steps (Ask before edits, or Auto's check stopping one), those wait on a card for me: carry on with what you can meanwhile.

1. Read the output and work out why. Fetch main first: if a commit since ${f.short} already fixes it, or another thread is on it, don't do it twice.
2. Fix the cause. A test that failed because the Mac was busy, or that flakes, gets made to hold up under load rather than just run again. Land the fix on main the usual way (AGENTS.md).
3. ${retry} Watch \`tb status\` until its "Following main" line no longer says failed (a release built and waiting to start, or up to date).
4. Once it's through, call end_turn with needs "nothing" and archive: true, so this never reaches my inbox. Only leave it for me if it needs a decision only I can make, a step is waiting on my yes, you can't push from this machine, or it still fails after a real attempt. Then tell me in a few lines what's wrong and what you tried.`;

Threadbear started this thread in the background in place of a banner, on this install's default mode. Sort it out without me if you can.

This machine follows GitHub's main (followOrigin in runner.json), and nothing lands here. Never commit on main in ${here}, and tb land refuses in this repo: a commit on a following machine's main leaves it days behind GitHub, as it can no longer fast-forward.

1. Read the output and work out why. Fetch GitHub's main first (git fetch origin): if a commit since ${f.short} already fixes it, or another thread is on it, don't do it twice.
2. If it was a one-off with nothing to fix (this machine was busy, say), remove "${path.join(home, 'runner', 'update.json')}" and the runner tries again within 5 minutes.
3. Otherwise get the fix to the main Mac, which lands it. A test that failed because this machine is slow gets made to hold up under load rather than just run again. Make the fix on a branch of your own. Then start a thread with create_thread, runner: "main", folder "${there}", with the failure and your reasoning, and ask it to land the fix: pushing alone lands nothing. If this machine can push a branch of its own (git push origin HEAD:<branch>, with a name the repo's rules let this machine push), name that branch in the brief; if it can't, put the whole diff in the brief, as the main Mac can't see this machine's branches.
4. Watch \`tb status\`: the fix reaches this machine by itself once it's on GitHub's main. While you wait, call end_turn with needs "nothing" and snooze "1d" (a newer failure wakes you). Once its "Following GitHub's main" line no longer says failed, call end_turn with needs "nothing" and archive: true. Only leave it for me if it needs a decision only I can make, a step is waiting on my yes, or it still fails after a real attempt.`;
