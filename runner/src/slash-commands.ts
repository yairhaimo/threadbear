//   - the CLI's: sent as typed (Claude's, and the Codex ones its adapter
//     maps to an app-server call: /compact, /review, a skill);
//   - Threadbear's: the runner does it, as the app would (/model, /effort,
//     Codex's /clear and /status), so the thread's settings stay the truth;
//   - one that can't work here: answered with a note saying what does.
// A path ("/Users/mike") isn't a command; a command neither CLI knows goes
// to the model as words, as it did before.
