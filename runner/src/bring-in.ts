// Starting a thread that brings Mike's releases into someone's fork
// (docs/setup-and-updates.md section 2.3, "Bringing them in by itself").
//
// Mike, 6 Nov 2026: rather than a banner or a nag, a fork's runner starts a
// thread every so often (every 5 days unless runner.json's
// `releases.bringIn` says otherwise) when there's a release main doesn't
// have. The thread does the merge in its own worktree and runs the checks
// (docs/bringing-in-updates.md), so it reaches the inbox with one question:
// land it? Asking before landing stays the rule.
//
// What keeps it from being annoying:
// - only when a release is waiting, so a quiet week starts nothing;
// - never more than one: while the last one is still open (not archived),
//   a newer release goes to that thread as a message, on the same timer,
//   rather than starting another;
// - a release with a commit Mike marked `Important:` doesn't wait for the
//   timer (unless it's off).
//
// The timer starts the first time this runs, so turning it on (or bringing
// in the release that has it) doesn't start a thread straight away.
