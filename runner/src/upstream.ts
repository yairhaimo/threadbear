// Mike's releases, for everyone's own copy of Threadbear
// (docs/setup-and-updates.md section 2.3).
//
// Everyone else's copy is a fork: `origin` is theirs and `upstream` is
// mikecann/threadbear. Their runner fetches upstream's release tags every
// six hours and says when there's a newer one than their main has, for the
// Updates panel's "new changes from Mike" and `tb updates`. Bringing it in
// is a thread they start (docs/bringing-in-updates.md); nothing here ever
// changes their main.
//
// Only tags signed with the key setup pinned (<home>/upstream-signers,
// copied from scripts/release-signers at setup) count. The pinned copy is
// the one that matters: a key changed in the repo, or a hijacked GitHub
// account, can't get code onto anyone's Mac this way. So the check is an
// SSH signature by that key and nothing else: the runner splits the tag
// itself and asks ssh-keygen, never `git verify-tag`, which hands a PGP or
// X.509 signature to gpg and the whole keyring whatever gpg.format says
// (Gautam's scan, 6 Nov 2026, F5).
//
// Tags are fetched into a folder of their own, outside the checkout, a
// few at a time and with a deadline (stageReleases), and only one that
// verifies is copied in, to refs/threadbear/upstream/; a release there is
// never moved to another object, so a tag swapped upstream after it was
// checked can't change what a bring-in thread merges (F31). Those threads
// are told the verified commit id, and merge that.
//
// Mike's own runner (runner.json `releases.publish`) makes the tags: once
// a day, if main has moved since the last one, it tags main's tip as
// release/YYYY-MM-DD, signed, and pushes the tag. Only a main it's safe to
// hand on: the runner it's running is main's, has been marked good and up
// for an hour, and main's tip is an hour old, so a commit that crashes
// the runner or is about to be followed by its fix isn't what goes out.
// And GitHub's checks have passed on that exact commit (ciVerdict): the
// runner staying up says nothing about the apps building. release/2026-11-04
// to -06 went out not building on Xcode 26.6, and people installing it
// found out before Mike did (PR #1, Maroš's fork).
