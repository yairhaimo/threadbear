// Review by another lab (Settings > General, runner.json `labReview`): when a
// turn that changed code ends with nothing needed, a review thread starts
// in the same folder on the other provider (Codex for a Claude thread,
// Claude for a Codex one), told to try to break the change without
// editing anything. The thread waits on it (end_turn's waitFor machinery,
// runner/hibernation.ts), wakes with its findings, and fixes what holds
// up. At most LAB_REVIEW_ROUNDS reviews between two of Mike's messages.
//
// Why: Mike's own rule is that a non-trivial fix gets another lab's
// review before it's called done, which he had agents do by hand through
// a skill. aq, Recur and Vorflux build it in (6 Nov 2026, thread d698c77d).
//
// A folder that a pool is kept for (the Convex pool, ~/dev/convex) only
// ever uses that pool's logins, as new threads there do: with no other
// lab's login in it, the review runs on a fresh session of the same
// provider, and the note says it isn't independent.
//
// A thread shut in a sandbox (ThreadRecord.confined) is reviewed in the
// sandbox too, on a login that can run there (Claude; Codex can't), or
// not at all, with a note saying why. Its review would otherwise run its
// tests on the host with the same access (Daybreak, 10 Nov 2026).
//
// Part of the Runner (runner.ts); each method's `this` is the Runner.
