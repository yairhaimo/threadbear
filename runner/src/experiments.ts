// Experiments: new features that start off for everyone, with a switch
// in runner.json (`"experiments": { "<id>": true }`) so Mike can run one
// on his own copy first. Once he's happy with it, the experiment and its
// switch are taken out and the feature just runs (AGENTS.md, "Experiments"),
// rather than its default flipping and the switch staying.
//
// Since the repo went public (5 Nov 2026) other people run Threadbear, so
// Mike asked on 6 Nov that features he's still trying out land here
// rather than straight on. Each one names the schedule that asks him,
// a few days after it lands, whether to turn it on for everyone, so
// none is forgotten (AGENTS.md, "Experiments"; experiments.test.ts
// checks every entry has one).
//
// Each experiment is a file of its own, `src/experiments/<id>.md`: its
// fields up top, then what it does (for the guide), where it lives and
// how to take it out (for forks). docs/experiments.md is made from them
// (experiment-docs.ts). One file each, rather than one list, because
// several threads add experiments at once and every one of them used to
// edit the same lines here, in the guide and in the forking table, and
// collide when landing (7 Nov). Releases copy all of src/, so the files
// go with the code.
