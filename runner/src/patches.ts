// Patches: what a thread's folder gives the app beyond the transcript
// (docs/threadbear-design/README.md): panels beside it and actions above
// the composer. Two kinds:
//
// - Built in, worked out from the folder alone: a `convex/` folder gives
//   the dashboard, an Xcode project the Simulator.
// - Patch files, `.threadbear/patches/*.ts` (or .js, .mjs) in the project
//   and in `~/.threadbear/patches/` for every project. Each is a module
//   whose default export says what it adds:
//
//     export default {
//       actions: [
//         { title: "Reseed dev DB", run: "npx convex run seed:reset" },
//         { title: "Explain the schema", prompt: "Read convex/schema.ts and explain it." },
//       ],
//       panels: [{ title: "Storybook", url: "http://localhost:6006" }],
//       hooks: [{ title: "Typecheck", on: "turn.end", run: "npx tsc --noEmit", edited: "**/*.ts" }],
//     }
//
//   The runner imports the file (Node runs TypeScript as it is) and reads
//   that object; a file that can't be loaded is listed with its error and
//   gives nothing. A project's file is only imported once it's trusted
//   (patch-trust.ts): until then it's listed as `untrusted` and gives
//   nothing, so opening a thread in someone else's repo runs none of it.
//
// Patches are found by walking up from the thread's folder to the home
// folder, so a thread started in a package of a monorepo still gets the
// project's; a parent folder's patches apply to every project under it.
//
// A thread in projects (projects.ts) also gets the patches of every folder
// of those projects, found the same way from each. Those are tagged with
// the folder and project, and their commands run in that folder rather
// than the thread's: a thread in ~/dev/me/misc that's about Poddle gets
// Poddle's dashboard and chips, and Poddle's Reseed runs in Poddle.
//
// Tool patches: a patch with `appliesTo` (globs of names, like
// "*.tandem") belongs to a tool rather than a place. It applies to a
// thread wherever a folder from the thread's own up holds a matching
// name, and only there, and runs in that folder. They're found in every
// project's folders, not just the thread's projects', so Tandem's patch
// lives in Tandem's repo and a video folder with a .tandem file gets it
// without being in the Tandem project.
//
// Live state: an action or panel can have `when` (hide it unless this
// says true) and `badge` (a count drawn on its chip or rail button),
// functions given the same context as a list panel's `items`. The runner
// calls them when it reads the patches (applyLive) and every little while
// for a thread that has any, so "Your turn" turns up once Mike has left
// comments, without a turn.
