// Which patch files the runner may load (docs/protocol.md, "Trusting a
// folder's patches").
//
// A patch file is code: the runner imports it, and its hooks, live
// functions and worktree setup run by themselves. Without a gate, opening a
// thread in a repo someone else wrote would run that repo's code before
// you'd sent a word. So a project's patch file only loads once you've
// trusted it, the way VS Code and Claude Code ask before running a
// folder's code.
//
// Trust is kept per folder (the one holding `.threadbear/`) as the hashes
// of the patch files you said yes to. A file whose content you haven't
// trusted waits: "new" when nothing in that folder has been trusted yet,
// "changed" when something has (a git pull brought a new version). A
// patch file a Full access thread's agent writes with Edit or Write in its
// own folder is trusted as it stands, as that agent could already run
// anything there, and asking about every button you ask for would be
// noise. Not in Ask or Auto, where it couldn't (code-writes.ts), and an
// Edit only when the file it started from was trusted: it vouches for
// what it changed, not for the rest of the file.
//
// A git worktree counts as its main checkout, so a thread's worktree of a
// trusted repo isn't asked about again. Only a worktree git itself made
// counts: the worktree's .git file and the repo's record of it must point
// at each other, so a folder can't claim to be a worktree of a trusted repo.
//
// Always trusted: ~/.threadbear/patches (yours, like ~/.zshrc) and
// Threadbear's own checkout (the code that's already running you).
//
// What's hashed is the patch file and every local file it imports, and
// theirs in turn (relative or absolute specifiers: `./lib/ask.ts`), so a
// pull that changes only a helper is asked about too. Files it names in a
// `./` or `../` path (the script its worktree setup or an action runs) are
// hashed as well, as they run by themselves too, and so is what those
// scripts run in turn (script-trust.ts), in an encoding no file name can
// fake (patchHash).
// Packages (`node:fs`, `zod`) aren't followed: they're the folder's
// dependencies, as `npm install` put them there, and hashing node_modules
// every 15 seconds would be slow and re-ask after every install. Files the
// repo commits under node_modules are its own code, though, and are hashed
// (tracked-packages.ts).
//
// The hash is only worth anything if it covers what will run. A patch that
// loads code by a name worked out when it runs (`import(name)`,
// `createRequire`), doesn't parse, or reaches more files than are followed,
// can't be checked, so it isn't loaded at all, trusted or not: its `error`
// says why (scanModule).
// Saying yes to it would trust whatever that name points at later. The
// same for a command it runs by itself (setup, hooks) that's anything but
// one hashed script and plain words (automaticCommand).
